### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at VU Amsterdam working on containers (Kubernetes and Docker), network, and software security. 

During my Ph.D., I am working on AI for Security within the cloud, for the [Sec4AI4Sec European project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101120393). Previously, I was working on the [AssureMOSS European project](https://assuremoss.eu/), on cloud and network security.

My previous publications are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vg42tTAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I hold a Double Master's degree in Cyber Security, from the University of Rennes 1, and the University of Trento, and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, from the University of Padua.
