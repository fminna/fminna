### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a PhD Candidate at VU Amsterdam University. I am working, as part of the AssureMOSS European project, at the detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities in FOSS libraries. More info here: https://assuremoss.eu/

I hold a Double Master's degree in Cyber Security and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
